# Customers Clustering use K-Means Clustering in one of Airline Industries by LRMFC Feature.

## Overview
In this digital era, many industries need data to find out every aspect of their business needs, retain their customers, and even predict trends that are in great demand by most of their customers. Therefore, to find out the characteristics of each customer, one of the airline industries wants to group each customer according to the track record of customer data, so that the company can easily make decisions and make changes to the right target.

## The Data
This dataset consists of **62988 rows** and **23 columns**. The following is a description of the dataset that will be analyzed to help understand what data we will use in this project.

Contents:
1. `MEMBER_NO` : ID Member (unique value).
2. `FFP_DATE` : Frequent Flyer Program Join Date (DateTime).
3. `FIRST_FLIGHT_DATE` : Date on the first flight (DateTime).
4. `GENDER` : Customer's gender (Male/Female).
5. `FFP_TIER` : Tier of Frequent Flyer Program (4/5/6).
6. `WORK_CITY` : Customer's hometown.
7. `WORK_PROVINCE` : Customer's province origin.
8. `WORK_COUNTRY` : Customer's country origin.
9. `AGE` : Customer's age.
10. `LOAD_TIME` : Date on data customer loaded (DateTime).
11. `FLIGHT_COUNT` : Total of customers flight.
12. `BP_SUM` : Travel plans.
13. `SUM_YR_1` : Fare Revenue.
14. `SUM_YR_2` : Votes Prices.
15. `SEG_KM_SUM` : Total distance (km) flights that have been done.
16. `LAST_FLIGHT_DATE` : Last flight date.
17. `LAST_TO_END` : Distance from last flight time to last flight order.
18. `AVG_INTERVAL` : The average time distance.
19. `MAX_INTERVAL` : Maximum time distance.
20. `EXCHANGE_COUNT` : Number of redemptions.
21. `avg_discount` : The average discount that customers get.
22. `Points_Sum` : The number of points earned by the customer.
23. `Point_NotFlight` : Points not used by members.

## Steps
The following are steps to carried out in this project.
1. Data understanding
2. Data preparation
3. Clustering
4. Visualization

## Conclusion
From a variety of users, can be classified into **5 groups** of the **five parameters** set (LRMFC) with the help of visualization using **Radar Chart** which aims to make clustering each user easier.
